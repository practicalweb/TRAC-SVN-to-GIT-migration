Use this script if you have an existing trac project which has built up a history with svn and you have switched to git.

This project will have tickets which reference svn revision numbers - but now the project needs git IDs instead.

convertTracSvnToGit.sh will extract a list of git IDs annd svn revision numbers from the history created by git-svn - and pass these to convertTracTickets.php

This will update the trac database - so that the links to commits still work.

This code has worked for me - but I STRONGLY SUGGEST TAKING BACKUPS before starting.

THIS CODE IS POTENTIALLY DESTRUCTIVE

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
